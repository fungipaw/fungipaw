  <dd>i'm often hanging around the bakery area! feel free to sit with me, but i probably won't be very talkative</dd>
  <dd>please don't copy my ponies! inspiration is fine, but i'd appreciate you making your own skin instead of copying mine!</dd>
  <dd>i often do friends list purges, so if i remove you then it's nothing personal!</dd>
  <dd>you're more than welcome to sit with me! i'm not always very talkative but i try my best</dd>
